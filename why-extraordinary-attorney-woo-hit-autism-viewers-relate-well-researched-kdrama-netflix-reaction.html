Produced by ENA and also acquired by Netflix, it has slowly stolen the hearts of international fans as it stars actress <a href=# rel>Park Eun-bin</a> as Woo Young-woo, an autistic lawyer. While neurodivergent fans were wary of the premise as K-dramas in the past have not done justice, ‘Extraordinary Attorney Woo’ is a well-researched show so far to the titular character with an autism spectrum disorder.</p><p>In ‘<a href=# rel>Extraordinary Attorney Woo</a>’, Woo Young-woo is the first autistic lawyer in South Korea with an IQ of 164, photographic memory and out-of-the-box thinking that allows her to crack even the most difficult of cases. However, she lacks social skills, has a low EQ and finds comfort in her love for music and whales. From the very first episode, <a href=# rel>Park Eun-bin</a> and the drama were commended for the portrayal of Young-woo and the rom-com aspect without mocking those with autism. Viewers also applauded the writers for their research on the disorder and how they addressed it sensitively.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ALSO READ</strong><br><a href=# rel>Anesthetist filmed sexually assaulting pregnant woman after heavily sedating her during C-section</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Who is Kyle Moorman?

The K-drama is also in the top 10 of <a href=# rel>Netflix</a> in several countries. The show also happens to be much loved in South Korea as viewers started relating to the character of Young-woo from the way she expressed her happiness and love for whales to heart-wrenching scenes of her struggling with her frustrations. A viewer who felt that they were probably like Park Eun-bin’s character has now gone viral on Korean chat forums.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TOP STORIES</strong><br><a href=# rel>'Thor: Love and Thunder': Fans slammed for demanding trigger warning for CHEMOTHERAPY scene</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Who is Felix Rubio?

So now I realized, there is light autism, not the severe kind, So I thought 'That's weird, I'm like that'." Viewers who also have autistic relatives appreciated the representation, “I didn't want to give the show a chance at first. I have an autistic cousin and I wasn't sure if the show would portray autism accurately. As it's a spectrum, people diagnosed with autism are different. I don't know about accuracy, but it's portrayed with compassion and sympathy.”</p><p>Another fan tweeted, “Thinking about how extensive the research moon jiwon must have done to write extraordinary attorney woo — from autism to law to whale facts. and then delicately weaving them to create the characters and story we now love. seriously, she deserves a lot of credit for eaw’s success.” One added, “I really love this drama, not only it’s refreshing but allowed the audience into the autism world. Make us more appreciative towards them. Can’t wait for each week new episodes on Netflix. My bet? She will win best actress award.” Another viewer was moved, “This episode is too heavy. these words from a perspective of a person with autism just breaks my heart.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I didn't want to give the show a chance at first.
