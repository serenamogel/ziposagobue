The other couples are Dave (<a href=#>Vince Vaughn</a>) and Ronnie (<a href=#>Malin Akerman</a>); Joey (<a href=#>Jon Favreau</a>) and Lucy (<a href=#>Kristin Davis</a>), and Shane (<a href=#>Faizon Love</a>) and Trudy (<a href=#>Kali Hawk</a>). Their troubles: (1) Parenting duties distract from romance; (2) Joey's wandering eye; (3) Shane has split from wife and is dating a 20-year-old bimbo.</p><p>They fly to the Eden resort, which uses locations on Bora Bora, a truly enchanted place that's reduced to the beach-party level. Eden is run by Monsieur Marcel (<a href=#>Jean Reno</a>), a martial-arts mystic, and managed by Cstanley (<a href=#>Peter Serafinowicz</a>), who explains his name is spelled with a "C." Other staff include Salvadore (Latin pop singer <a href=#>Carlos Ponce</a>), doubling for a model on the cover of a lesser romance novel.</p><p>The formula itself might have supported hilarity, but the story lacks character specifics. Each couple behaves relentlessly as an illustration of their problem. The movie depends for excitement on a shark attack during a scuba-diving exercise, featuring clueless sharks, inflamed by the smell of blood, who circle aimlessly going "boo!" Salvadore charms the wives somewhat ambiguously with his oiled pecs and bottles of pineapple-rum drinks. The men don't bond as much as stand together onscreen and exchange bonding dialogue.</p><p>There is a twin resort named East Eden, which has all swinging singles, as opposed to troubled couples. It's a party scene every night; as nearly as I could tell, our four couples are the only clients on West Eden, so no wonder there was a 50 percent off deal, despite Cstanley's talk of the long waiting list.</p><p>Among the better things in "Couples Retreat," I count Vaughn's well-timed and smart dialogue; the eccentricity of Love and Hawk in contrast to the cookie-cutter couples, and Serafinowicz's meticulous affectations, which suggest psychotropic medication.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cpq6onJrAbr7EramemaRif3F8mA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
