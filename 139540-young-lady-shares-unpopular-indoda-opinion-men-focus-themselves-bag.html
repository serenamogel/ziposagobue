She took a spin on the popular "Indoda must" tagline to say that men should focus on themselves first.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/79db1cde45d7ca70.png><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nickii Zuma</a> is the woman who made the statement and shared it in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook</a> post, where she quickly gained new fans from it.</p><p class=align-left>The "Indoda must" phrase is quite notorious on South African social media. Many women use it as a means to list the requirements they want from a man. Nickii's post took a more empathetic spin on it, starting with this sentence:</p>"Indoda must focus on himself, fix his life and work on being the best version of himself."<p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Follow us on <a id=https://www.instagram.com/brieflynews/ href=# title="Briefly News Instagram" rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> - get the most important news directly in your favourite app!</p><p class=align-left>The lady then went on to explain the other things a man should take care of in his own life, including his own family.</p><p class=align-left>The last sentence in her explanation hit home for many peeps:</p>"A man who takes care of your needs should be a man who chooses to take care of your needs not a man who feels obligated to do so!"<p class=align-left>Netizens mostly had positive things to say about the post, while some women disagree. See the comments below:</p><p class=align-left>Olwethu Spectre Max said:</p>" agree... We're low-key becoming fathers to our girlfriends now.
