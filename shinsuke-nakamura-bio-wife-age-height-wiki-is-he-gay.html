However, the Kyoto native currently resides in Florida city, Orlando. Information on the professional wrestler’s earlier days is not public knowledge. The great success of his wrestling career has outshined his life prior to the start of his career.</p><p>Shinsuke Nakamura began his professional wrestling career on the 29th of August, 2002. As the year progressed, he was hailed as one of the most prodigious wrestlers in NJPW. The most prominent factor for this fact was his fighting style. Combining fast athletic strikes with strong submission holds, Shinsuke was able to defeat most of his opponents. Shinsuke Nakamura is a former mixed martial artist, and was trained by former professional wrestler and martial artist Hussain ‘Antonio’ Inoki; the late Kotetsu Yamamoto, a former professional wrestler, and referee; and Osamu Kido, a Japanese professional wrestler for NJPW.</p><p>Shinsuke Nakamura won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship three times while he was wrestling for NJPW, winning it the first time as the youngest champion when he was 23 years old. He has also won the company’s Grade One Climax tournament, and the 2014 Japan Cup. Added to his laurels are five-time and longest reigning IWGP Intercontinental Champion. Shinsuke was the final National Wrestling Federation Heavyweight Champion before the title was discontinued. With tag team partner Hiroshi Tanahashi, Shinsuke was able to defeat his opponents to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship on the 11th of December, 2004. He later faced his own partner on the 4th of January, 2005 and won, becoming the IWGP U-30 Openweight Champion.</p><p>Shinsuke Nakamura left on a brief excursion in 2006 to improve on his wrestling skills. After losing to a fight against Brock Lesnar earlier in the year Shinsuke would meet the American wrestler for personal training and muscle mass building. Down the line, in his career, Shinsuke became a heel— the wrestling term for a villain and formed a group with former Great Bash Heel members called CHAOS. He became known as the King of Strong Style when he announced his plan to restore the Strong Style of New Japan.</p><p>Shinsuke Nakamura’s contract with NJPW eventually came to an end, and in February he moved to WWE, coming in as part of the company’s NXT roster. Doubts fueled some minds as to Shinsuke’s performance on American soil, but he proved himself. He was transferred to SmackDown’s main roster, where he defeated greats like Randy Orton and John Cena. But his ultimate victory so far is his win against Roman Reigns at the 2018 Royal Rumble Match.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span><strong>Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shinsuke Nakamura has had a very extensive and successful professional wrestling career, and it looks like he’s still got more years going for him. With all that he has accomplished, his net worth is estimated at a nice $3.5 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-he-gay-or-does-he-have-a-wife></span><strong>Is He Gay, Or Does He Have A Wife?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On the 1st of September, 2007 Shinsuke Nakamura tied the knot with his longtime girlfriend Maekawa. Together they reside in the United States, living in harmony and good company. They have no children, but that hasn’t diminished the relationship. There are no rumors about them splitting or getting a divorce. With these facts, all fingers point towards Shinsuke Nakamura being straight, however, the pro wrestler has never publicly commented on his sexual orientation.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height-and-body-measurements></span><strong>Height and Body Measurements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shinsuke Nakamura stands at a rather tall height of 6 feet 2 inches or 188 cm. He has an equally sturdy body weight of 100 kg or 220 pounds. He has long black hair and dark brown eyes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuYnru0wcqeZKeZm5a6tr7AZpmip12stqexjJqenmWYmraotNNmrqKjmWK2tHnHnmSgmalk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
