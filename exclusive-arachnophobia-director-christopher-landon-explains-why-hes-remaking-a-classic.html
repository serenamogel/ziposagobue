And he was showing me all different kinds of species of spiders, and I was terrified. So it’s a it’s a huge dream come true. I’m a huge fan of the original. I think it’s a really, really fun film. But I don’t, I’m not trying to apply any kind of pressure to myself. I don’t want to be in competition with another movie, that movie will always stand alone.</p><p>And so for me, the goal was to just… and the reason why I agreed to do it in the first place is not just because, “Ooh, here’s a cool remake”. I actually had a take, I had an idea for it that was different from the original, but still honors, I think, the original and I’m just very, very excited and very eager to make that film. I think we’re gonna make it this year. I don’t want to like jinx it, I’m knocking on whatever I can find. But we’re pretty far along in the process. So I feel like it’s looking good.”</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>Hopefully the Arachnophobia remake does shoot this year, because Landon has proven that he’s got an impeccable grasp on blending the hilarious with the horrifying. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We Have a Ghost releases on Netflix on Feb. 24</a>, and be sure to check back next week for our full interview.</p><p data-characters=2 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonLGbnKrAqsLEZpirmZOdu7C8x6iZopldmbazscKtpqtlk52%2Fqr%2FTqKehnaJiuaK6w6ilZp2opbmitc2sZLCgqWK1pr%2BMq5ymmZueu6h5wGaapZmjqLakew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
