Doug Edmunds is a self-described “superfan” of the local theater and has attended hundreds, if not thousands, of plays. On Tuesday, he unexpectedly found himself the main character in a near tragedy.
“I got some extra doughnuts from Hale Center Theatre in Orem and I was delivering them to that house, my next-door neighbor,” Edmunds said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

On Tuesday, he unexpectedly found himself the main character in a near tragedy.</p><p>“I got some extra doughnuts from Hale Center Theatre in Orem and I was delivering them to that house, my next-door neighbor,” Edmunds said. “The wind was 60 to 70 miles an hour! Big time! Not when it first started — just all of a sudden, it hit! So I turned my back and all of a sudden one of those limbs locked me down, broke my glasses and I knew that a tree had fallen on me when I’m down there (thinking), ‘Hey what is all this?!'”</p><p>Edmunds was buried under the branches of his neighbor’s pine tree. He said he estimated the tree to have been at least 55 feet tall.</p><p>Utah’s forecast had warned against snow squalls during the week, and the tree that hit Edmunds <a href=#>wasn’t the only tree to collapse</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Winter storm knocks tree onto Brigham City home</a></p><p>“It was nighttime. It was dark and could’ve froze to death, so it was pretty serious,” he said. “Had I been anywhere in that driveway, I would’ve been killed. When you see the limbs there and the trunk, so I probably missed death by maybe a second, two seconds, three seconds? So (I’m) one lucky character.”</p><p>Edmunds said his car was still stuck in front of the tree but wasn’t damaged, and the tree will be chopped up and hauled away on Thursday.</p><p>As for Edmunds himself?</p><p>“My shoulder is hurting a little bit, but nothing bad. It did break my glasses,” he said. “So I must’ve hit hard, but I’m in good shape for 85!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijo6HBt3rCqKRobmFohXh9jnFsZrGVlr9uu8udZKaZnmK7pq3RpbBmo5mhuaawjJuwZpufobmivNKem2asopqybrXNZqytmZhiwK%2B71maqqq2Roblw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
