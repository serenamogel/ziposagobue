So far, it has secured impressive scores on review platforms, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">initially opening to a 100% Rotten Tomatoes score</a>.

The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">8-episode first season</a> of the series, released altogether on Nov. 3, 2023, is available to watch exclusively on Netflix.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>The husband-wide creator duo is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">known for their previous projects like Logan (2017) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017)</a>, but Blue Eye Samurai hits a little close to home for the duo. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Screen Rant</a>, Noizumi beautifully put together the inspiration behind the series:</p><p>“A lot of it came from just my mixed race background, just feeling stuck between two worlds, and deciding, “What if we put those feelings into a world in Japan, where the borders were closed, where it was so homogenous, and that era is still heralded as the golden age of Japan? The golden age, where nobody was allowed in who looked different, and what that must have felt like. Just, let’s make a good story out of that.“</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=822 data-injectable=true>And the creators did exactly that. The series follows a half-white half-Japanese&nbsp;swordmaster&nbsp;named Mizu who lives a life in disguise seeking to deliver revenge. Why is she in disguise? She lives in 17th century Japan, where borders are closed to the outside world, and citizens would never see a face that was not Japanese. Mizu blames the only four white men who were in Japan at the time of her birth for making her a “creature of shame,” and sets off to kill them while concealing her gender and bright-blue eyes.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>The series boasts a powerful voice cast including Maya Erskine, George Takei, Masi Oka, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Brenda Song, Darren Barnet, Randall Park, and Kenneth Branagh. The vivid animation has a live-action edge where everything feels real from sceneries to characters.
