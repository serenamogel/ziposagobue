The story distractedly gloms itself onto "Cinderella"&nbsp;as well: Claire works at a hotel that used to be owned by her late father but passed into the clutches of her wicked stepmother Maud (Huppert). Maud is so jealous of Claire's youth and beauty that she hires an assassin to kill her, but the attempt is botched and Claire ends up staying in a beautiful house in the woods and being&nbsp;cared for by seven men from the local community. The men are of various ages and body types, but most are upfront about their desire for the heroine (an eighth man in Claire's life is a local priest played by&nbsp;<a href=#>Richard Fréchette</a>, who eventually tries to save Maud's soul as well).&nbsp;</p><p>Fontaine has had success making films that play around with various genres, including the picaresque tale starring a fool (represented by three comedies focusing on the character of <a href=#>Augustine Dos Santos</a>); the biographical drama ("<a href=#>Coco Before Chanel</a>"); the postmodern riff on a classic novel&nbsp;("<a href=#>Gemma Bovery</a>"), and the gothic family horror film ("How I&nbsp;Killed My Father"). This one doesn't really come together, in large part because the heroine doesn't seem to have been fully thought-through by Fontaine and cowriter <a href=#>Pascal Bonitzer</a> in terms of consistent motivation, something a main character needs even in a fairy tale.&nbsp;</p><p>In theory, Claire's sexual adventurism is a response to her annoyance at constantly being described&nbsp;as&nbsp;"pure," but the movie never goes deeper. The script makes it feel like Claire is sleeping with various "dwarves" because she can't figure out what else to do with herself, which surely couldn't have the been the point. And despite Claire sometimes carrying on like a newly liberated woman&nbsp;from a sexually explicit,&nbsp;conversation-starting 1970s novel&nbsp;like Fear of Flying&nbsp;("I didn't know what desire was," Claire says at one point, "but now I do"), the film incidentally validates a lot of ideas that humanity seems to have taken recent baby steps towards growing&nbsp;beyond. For instance,&nbsp;that it's charming for a man to grab or kiss a woman that he desires without her consent,&nbsp;as long as he's an awkward&nbsp;goofball who means well; that a young body is being wasted if it's not having a lot of sex; that older women are innately threatened by younger ones because so much social currency is bound up in looks, and that all of this is&nbsp;the natural order of things. (Maud is constantly checking her appearance in every available reflective surface.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46wn6KslWKutHnSp6awZZ2kw6qxjKucr6GVrHpzfJFq</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
