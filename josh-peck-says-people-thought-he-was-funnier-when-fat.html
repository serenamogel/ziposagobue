At just 10 years old, he was already doing standup at comedy clubs, which he said was a “defense mechanism” for being overweight as a child.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>“It wasn’t going to be Little League, my cardiovascular was just not up to par at that age, I was just really into Fruit Roll-Ups, Gushers — I was heavy on the fruit snacks, I’m not gonna lie,” the now 35-year-old joked.</p><p data-characters=561 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=true>“But yeah, I found my first agent from Backstage magazine when I was nine years old, I don’t know how it came into my possession,” he continued. “I went and interviewed with him and he said, ‘I get young standups time at legit clubs in New York — Gotham, Carolines — if you can put an act together, I’ll get you up.’ And a week later I was performing at Carolines comedy club. And, from then on, I was sneaking into the backs of most comedy clubs in New York so they wouldn’t lose their liquor license.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=768 data-injectable=true>“I think my comedy came as a defense mechanism for growing up overweight, and I basically felt real or imagined and I’d walk into most rooms at that age and at my weight at a disadvantage, that people made a snap judgment about me that I was, you know, slothful or lacked willpower or something,” Peck shared. “And that it was incumbent on me to sort of not necessarily even stand out; I just wanted to be on the same level as everyone else.”</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Despite his insecurities, Peck made his big acting breakthrough on the Nickelodeon sketch comedy series All That in 2000, and later The Amanda Show starring then-tween star Amanda Bynes, before landing a lead on Drake & Josh in 2004. Peck recalled how audience perceptions changed when finally he dropped the weight between seasons three and four.</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=850 data-injectable=true>“I imagine it must have been odd, for people to have watched this person that they sort of fell in love with — with this look and this size — and suddenly, there’s this massive sort of shift,” he explained. “When I did lose the weight, there was certainly a small contingent that thought, ‘Oh, you were funnier when you were fat or you took away this guy who we loved and we’re not so sure if we love this new guy.’ So, that was very odd to navigate.”</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>Regardless of his size, Peck has been successful in making the transition from child star to adult actor.
