Spearheaded by the mind of Chuck Williams, who was responsible for 2020’s Sonic the Hedgehog (a film that could very well ramp up into a cinematic universe if its sequels stay steady), the Pac-Man prospect is one that should be exercised with equal parts fascination and caution; how could it possibly work, and will we get a Galaga mid-credits scene?</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>But the world of entertainment wouldn’t have a fraction of its traction without the internet’s incessant reflex to make everything into a meme, and it seems everyone had the same idea when they caught wind of such a project.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Chris Pratt on his way to voice the live-action PAC-MAN <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Q8WKXYvGNK</a></p>— brenton (@dcuverse) <a href=#>August 8, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>With Hollywood’s most controversial Chris making some unsavory rounds on Twitter again, it seemed the perfect time to plunge the actor into a ridiculous hypothetical that, if we cast our minds back to the events of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, may not be that ridiculous after all.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Chris Pratt will return as Pac-Man. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QM2KjfMFFN</a></p>— I am Flash (@IamFlash00) <a href=#>August 8, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>The good people of Twitter, of course, are referring to the scene in James Gunn’s sophomore MCU project where Star-Lord, played by Chris Pratt faces off against his father, Ego.
