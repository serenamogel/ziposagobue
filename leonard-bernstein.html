Best known for composing the Broadway musical West Side Story, his inspired and voracious conducting style led to his big break conducting the New York Philharmonic in 1943. He was one of the first American-born conductors to lead world-class orchestras and achieve global fame. Bernstein composed many works, including musicals like On the Town and Wonderful Town, operas like Candide, and large-scale musical pieces like Mass. After battling emphysema, he died at age 72 in 1990.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Leonard Bernstein<br>BORN: August 25, 1918<br>BIRTHPLACE: Lawrence, Massachusetts<br>DIED: October 14, 1990<br>SPOUSE: Felicia Cohn Montealegre Bernstein (1951-1978)<br>CHILDREN: Jamie, Alexander, and Nina<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Virgo</p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Early Life and Education" data-anchor-id=early-life-and-education class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life and Education</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Leonard Bernstein was born on August 25, 1918, in Lawrence, Massachusetts. His birth name was Louis, a name his grandmother adored, but his family always called him Lenny or Leonard, which he officially renamed himself at age 16.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His father, Sam Bernstein, was a Russian immigrant who in his native Ukraine was destined to become a rabbi. Once he arrived and settled on New York City’s Lower East Side, the elder Bernstein took up working as a fish cleaner. He eventually got a job sweeping floors in his uncle Henry’s barbershop and then landed a position stocking wigs for a dealer. Sam eventually built a rather profitable business distributing beauty products. Leonard grew up understanding that business and success were paramount, and “occupations” in the field of music and art were simply off-limits.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bernstein first played piano, one belonging to his aunt Clara, when he was 10. Clara was going through a divorce and needed a place to store her massive upright piano. Lenny loved everything about the instrument, but his father refused to pay for lessons. Determined, the boy raised his own small pot of money to pay for a few sessions. He was a natural from the start, and by the time his bar mitzvah rolled around, his father was impressed enough to buy him a baby grand piano. The young Bernstein found inspiration everywhere and played with a voracity and spontaneity that impressed anyone who listened.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bernstein attended Boston Latin School, where he met his first real teacher and his lifelong mentor, Helen Coates. After graduating, he entered Harvard University, where he studied music theory with Arthur Tillman Merritt and counterpoint with Walter Piston. In 1937, Bernstein attended a Boston Symphony concert conducted by Dmitri Mitropoulos. Bernstein’s heart sang when he saw the bald Greek man gesture with his bare hands, exuding a rare kind of enthusiasm for every score. At a reception the next day, Mitropoulos heard Bernstein play a sonata, and he was so moved by the young man’s abilities that he invited him to attend his rehearsals. Bernstein spent a week with him. After the experience, he was determined to make music the center of his life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To strengthen his technical skills, Bernstein spent a year of intensive training at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He studied conducting with Fritz Reiner, a man who believed in mastering every detail of every piece. Bernstein benefited from the discipline, but he believed in more than the mechanics. In 1940, when he was 22, the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood invited Bernstein to join some 300 other talented students and professional musicians for a summer of musical exploration and performance. He was one of only five students accepted in the master class in conducting that was taught by the famed Serge Koussevitzky. The man became a father figure to Bernstein, encouraging his belief in the power and importance of music.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 title="Early Conducting Career" data-anchor-id=early-conducting-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Conducting Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite Bernstein’s passion and brilliance, he found himself out of work after the summer at Tanglewood. He took odd jobs transcribing music for a while, but then out of pure luck, he was offered an incredible opportunity. Due to the war draft, very few able musicians remained stateside. When the New York Philharmonic sought an assistant conductor, Bernstein accepted the position from conductor Artur Rodzinski. Bernstein was the first American and youngest person to become assistant conductor. On November 14, 1943, the symphony’s guest conductor, the very prestigious Bruno Walter, had fallen ill. Rodzinski, able but generous, ordered Bernstein to step up and conduct that afternoon’s concert.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Step up he did. The young conductor amazed his crowd and his players. Ecstatic applause inspired The New York Times to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1943/11/16/85134894.html?pageNumber=22" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="publish an article" data-vars-ga-product-id=e109654f-c92e-46be-a81d-f5040308c4b5 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1943/11/16/85134894.html?pageNumber=22" data-product-url="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1943/11/16/85134894.html?pageNumber=22" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftimesmachine.nytimes.com%2Ftimesmachine%2F1943%2F11%2F16%2F85134894.html%3FpageNumber%3D22" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=007ba27d-7b86-4549-8658-a16aeb36e0f2 class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">publish an article</a> about his performance, writing: “It’s a good American success story. The warm, friendly triumph of it filled Carnegie Hall and spread far over the airwaves.” The story was reprinted in newspapers around the country, and Bernstein became a respected conductor overnight, one who would lead the Philharmonic 11 times by the end of the season.</p><img alt="a black and white photograph closeup of leonard bernstein, wearing a suit and looking off camera" title="Composer Leonard Bernstein in 1945" width=2330 height=2969 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/closeup-photograph-of-leonard-bernstein-news-photo-1696526395.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Leonard Bernstein in 1945</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Over the next several years, he conducted the New York City Center orchestra and appeared as a guest conductor across the United States, Europe, and Israel.

Nevertheless, it was well-reviewed and became a great success, with Jean Arthur portraying Peter Pan and Boris Karloff performing the dual role of Captain Hook and George Darling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Next, Bernstein wrote the musical Trouble in Tahiti (1951), a 45-minute two-character chamber piece about a bored, upper-middle-class couple. In 1953, Bernstein wrote the score for the musical Wonderful Town, about two sisters from Ohio who move to a basement apartment in New York City to seek respective careers as a writer and actor. Bernstein had just five weeks to compose the music, during which time he practically locked himself in his apartment with his playwrights Joseph A. Fields and Jerome Chodorov to focus on the work, according to the biographer Burton. The musical later won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Actress for star Rosalind Russell.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bernstein worked on scores for two Broadway shows simultaneously in the mid-1950s.

The second was one of Bernstein’s most celebrated works: West Side Story, a musical inspired by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/william-shakespeare data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="William Shakespeare" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">William Shakespeare</a>’s play in Romeo and Juliet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">West Side Story follows Tony and Maria as they navigate their budding romance amid a street gang rivalry between the Jets and the Sharks on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. “Everybody told us that the show was an impossible project,” Bernstein said, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Somethings-Coming-Something-Good-Imagination/dp/155783766X data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Something’s Coming, Something Good: West Side Story and the American Imagination" data-vars-ga-product-id=48f59c3c-fa0f-40a7-a295-d832f2c84685 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/Somethings-Coming-Something-Good-Imagination/dp/155783766X data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/Somethings-Coming-Something-Good-Imagination/dp/155783766X data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/Somethings-Coming-Something-Good-Imagination/dp/155783766X data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c754abb3-3204-4f94-a191-fe83f09385e4","site_id":"73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=8abf2a63-5577-4819-a898-608137c63227 class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">Something’s Coming, Something Good: West Side Story and the American Imagination</a> by Misha Berson. “Besides, who wanted to see a show in which the first-act curtain comes down on two dead bodies lying on the stage?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Collaborating with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/jerome-robbins data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jerome Robbins" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jerome Robbins</a>, Arthur Laurents, and the legendary <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/stephen-sondheim data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stephen Sondheim" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stephen Sondheim</a>, Bernstein infused jazz and Latin rhythms into traditional orchestral tunes and extended dance sequences for the West Side Story score. Amid concerns that the music was too depressing or sophisticated for popular audiences, Bernstein fought back against other members of the creative team who wanted to cut some of the more complex operatic sequences. Bernstein’s instincts proved correct, as the show garnered unanimous rave reviews upon opening in 1957, earning six Tony Award nominations, including one for Best Musical, though that award went to The Music Man.

Debuting at the Houston Grand Opera, A Quiet Place was panned by critics, much to Bernstein’s great disappointment. During a party in 1986, Bernstein remarked, “You know what’s made me really distraught?
