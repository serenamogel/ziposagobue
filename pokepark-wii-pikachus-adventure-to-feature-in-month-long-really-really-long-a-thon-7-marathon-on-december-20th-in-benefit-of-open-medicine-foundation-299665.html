This is a speedrun that infamously takes over two weeks to complete due to the requirement of needing to wait a total of 336 hours outside of menus in real time to obtain the Splendid Hair item. Due to the excessive amount of downtime in which the game is left idle, it would have been against Twitch's Terms of Service without something else happening on the stream. Ergo, the game was left running in a corner of the stream except for a few hours periodically in which it took the focus to make further progress on other objectives. In the years since, it became a charity marathon maintaining its focus on speedruns that take a very long time to complete, that would otherwise not be shown in marathons.</p><p>The Really Really Long A Thon's support of the Open Medicine Foundation came about due to health issues suffered by both xel, and RRLAT co-owner Frostie. OMF is an organization founded in 2012 by Linda Tannenbaum to study and treat myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. It brings world-renowned scientists together to study, diagnose, treat, and cure complex diseases, including ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, and long COVID.</p><p>The details and expected times for the Pokémon run at RRLAT7 is as follows. Please note that these times were correct at time of writing, but may be subject to change based on delays in the marathon - or possibly even really really long games finishing faster than expected.
