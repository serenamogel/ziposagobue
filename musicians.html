When Solange was 16, her father, who was also her manager, signed her to his record company, Music World Entertainment. In 2002, she appeared on two major musical projects: Lil' Romeo's Game Time album and former Destiny's Child member <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/kelly-rowland data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kelly Rowland" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kelly Rowland</a>'s Simply Deep, for which Solange wrote the title track.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Solange's debut album, Solo Star, was released in 2003.
