He was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of felony domestic violence</a> over a 2020 incident with a woman he was dating.

On Twitter, he shared the statement with one word: “justice.”</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>“I have always known that these claims were false,” he said, “and I never had any doubt that this day would come.” He said he was “thankful” that the case was dismissed but “deeply shaken by all the horrible lies that were reported about me during this process.”</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>The thing that disappointed him the most, he said, was that “so many people were so quick to judge without knowing the facts.” He then called his accuser an “embittered ex trying to bypass due process and have me ‘cancelled.'” He said the fact that it actually happened was “shameful.”</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>This doesn’t mean he’s giving up. In fact, quite the opposite. “Now that the legal case has ended, I’m determined to move forward and focus both on my creative projects and restoring my good name.”</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>While he’s been cleared of court, Roiland’s reputation has perhaps been permanently damaged by a number of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">inappropriate DMs</a> with women and minors. Here’s a sample:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Na fuck Justin Roiland.
