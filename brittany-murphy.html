After the success of Clueless, she starred in critically acclaimed films like Girl, Interrupted, 8 Mile and Sin City, and enjoyed a long-running voice role on the animated King of the Hill. The actress died at age 32 of what was determined to be a combination of pneumonia, anemia and prescription medications.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Murphy was born November 10, 1977, in Atlanta, Georgia, to parents Sharon Murphy and Angelo Bertolotti. Murphy's father was heavily involved in organized crime and spent most of his life in and out of prison. As a result, Murphy's parents split when she was only two years old.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Murphy and her mother moved to Edison, New Jersey, shortly after the divorce. It was during this time that Murphy became interested in acting and performing. To encourage her talents, Murphy's mother enrolled her in Verne Fowler's School of Dance and Theater in Colonia, New Jersey, when she was five years old. It was there that Murphy took dance and voice lessons until she was in her early teens.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Child Actor</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the time Murphy was eight, she had determined that she wanted to be a star.

Her husband, screenwriter Simon Monjack, was hospitalized for health problems.

Initial reports indicated that she had been fired from the film, but Murphy denied the rumors.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shortly after the news that she had lost the job due to her poor attitude and spotty attendance on set, Murphy died on December 20, 2009.

The actress was only 32 years old. Her husband died five months later.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the time of her passing, rumors circulated regarding possible drug use or an eating disorder contributed to her death.

Murphy reportedly served as a witness for Julia Davis, a Homeland Security employee who revealed problems within the organization.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The topic of Murphy's mysterious passing was revived for the 2020 documentary Brittany Murphy: An ID Mystery, which followed her father's investigative efforts before his own death in 2019 and explored the possibility that the actress was poisoned.</p><ul data-node-id=34 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Brittany Murphy</li><li>Birth Year: 1977</li><li>Birth date: November 10, 1977</li><li>Birth State: Georgia</li><li>Birth City: Atlanta</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Brittany Murphy was an actress who appeared in a string of critically acclaimed films, including 'Clueless,' 'Girl, Interrupted' and '8 Mile'.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Film</li><li>Television</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Scorpio</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>John Burroughs High School</li><li>Verne Fowler's School of Dance and Theater</li></ul><li>Death Year: 2009</li><li>Death date: December 20, 2009</li><li>Death State: California</li><li>Death City: Los Angeles</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/page/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=38><ul data-node-id=40 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Brittany Murphy Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actor/brittany-murphy</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: April 14, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwrtGiq62Znq56rsHRqZ%2By</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
