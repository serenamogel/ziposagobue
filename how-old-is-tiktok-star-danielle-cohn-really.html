What earned Cohn such a unique appeal was whether her loose tongue and questionable content merited her age. Since she was (presumably) 11 years old, her followers have speculated whether the influencer was being less than forthcoming about her age, and to this day, the situation remains a grey area with Cohn saying one thing and her family saying another.</p><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=151 data-injectable=false>Is Cohn‚Äôs real age a case of sleight of hand, or has the TikToker been pulling the wool over our eyes?

Around this time, Cohn‚Äôs father, Dustin Cohn, came out in contradiction of his daughter‚Äôs claim that she was 16, saying in a lengthy Facebook post that not only was he weary of her online content, but that she was actually 14 years old. He followed this up by posting a picture of her birth certificate where a March 7, 2006 birth date can clearly be seen. That would make Cohn 14 years old at the time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>A year later, Cohn uploaded a video to YouTube in which she denied the online claims, including her father‚Äôs, that she was born in 2006. ‚ÄúI know how people feel about my age, whatever, let them think what they want,‚Äù she said. The reason Cohn‚Äôs age had become such a hot button topic at this time was because she was famously dating fellow TikToker Mikey Tue, whose age was undisputedly 18. That would make him an adult and her a minor.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@daniellecohn href=#>@daniellecohn</a><p>Get your <a title=femininehygiene href=#>#femininehygiene</a> onü•∞ü•∞link in bioü•íü•í</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Daniellecohn" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Daniellecohn</a></figure><p data-characters=612 data-current-count=912 data-injectable=false>The two broke up shortly after 2020, but Cohn‚Äôs age remains a mystery. Her mother, Jennifer Archambault has held steadfast to Cohn‚Äôs claims that she was born in 2004, despite the evidence brought forth by Cohn‚Äôs father. Cohn herself continues to insist she was born in 2004, making her 18 years old as of this writing. She currently has over 25 million followers online, a feminine brand called Feel Divine, music available to stream on Spotify and Apple Music, and paid partnerships that she advertises on her various platforms. Whatever age Danielle Cohn is, she‚Äôs putting in the work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8qbvWZqalnF2ewG7AyKSrqKNdqMGivoydmKehlaG5pnnCqJ%2BnZaKarq242Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
