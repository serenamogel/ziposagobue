He initially pursued his degree with a major in technology management and industrial economics at Chalmers University of Technology Gothenburg. In the year 2010, throughout his time at university, he signed up for a YouTube account with the name PewDiePie. In the same year, he expelled out of University after losing attention in his degree field. After failing to get a traineeship with a marketing agency located in Scandinavia, he afterwards made up his mind to concentrate on creating stuff for his YouTube channel. With the sole intention of funding his videos, PewDiePie started selling copies of his Artistic Photoshop projects and worked at a hot dog stance. He soon gathered a prompt escalation in his online following, and in 2012, his YouTube channel crossed around one million subscribers.</p><p>In the year 2013, PewDiePie emerged as the most-subscribed personality on YouTube, being temporarily exceeded in 2013 by way of YouTube Spotlight and many times in 2019 by an Indian recording brand called T-Series. From 2014 to 2017, PewDiePie’s YouTube channel was emerged as the most-viewed channel. As of 2019, this YouTube channel has crossed around 23 billion video views and 100 million subscribers, ranking as eleventh-most viewed and second-most subscribed channel on platform.</p><p>PewDiePie’s most famous YouTube stuff is his Let’s Play game commentaries, commonly of horror games and more lately, in 2019, Minecraft, even though he used to create a massive range of comic content such as reviews and memes. His YouTube content has been acclaimed as unfiltered and genuine, and under several circumstances, come across with controversy. By means of early 2017 controversy with respect to accusations of anti-Semitism in numerous of PewDiePie’s videos, Maker Studios – a multi-channel grid he was signed has finished their business with him. Whilst he critiqued the whole coverage of this situation and protected his YouTube content as gags that were taken beyond context, he acknowledged its indecency.</p><p>PewDiePie was born and raised in Gothenburg. He was born to Ulf Christian Kjellberg and Lotta Kristine Johanna, and raised with his elder sister named Fanny. His mom, a previous CIO, was called CIO of the Year 2010 of Sweden. His father is also a business executive.</p><h3>Gallery</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pewdiepie-pandia-150x150.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pewdiepie-pandia-225x300.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pewdiepie-hight-300x215.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pewdiepie-face-300x225.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pewdiepie-brwo-300x211.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pewdiepie-bra-300x200.jpg><h3>PewDiePie Education</h3><p><strong>Qualification: </strong>Degree in Industrial Economics and Technology Management (Incomplete</p><p><strong>School: </strong>Goteborgs Hogre Samskola, Sweden</p><p><strong>College: </strong>Chalmers University of Technology</p><h3>PewDiePie Career</h3><p><strong>Profession: </strong>YouTuber</p><p><strong>Net Worth: </strong>$20 Million</p><h3>Family & Relatives</h3><p><strong>Father: </strong>Ulf Christian Kjellberg</p><p><strong>Mother: </strong>Lotta Kristine Johanna</p><p><strong>Sister: </strong>Fanny</p><p><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Engaged</p><p><strong>Fiancé:</strong> Marzia Kjellberg</p><p><strong>Past Relationships:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Marzia Bisognin</a> (YouTuber aka CutiePie)</p><h3 id=facts>Facts You Never Knew About PewDiePie</h3><ul><li>Is PewDiePie addicted to smoking? : Not Known</li><li>Is PewDiePie alcoholic? : Yes</li><li>He resides in Brighton, England, United Kingdom.</li><li>He supported his channel on YouTube by way of selling hot dogs.
