Unfortunately, he has also overspent (particularly on real estate, cars, and lawsuits), prompting him to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2015. There’s a lot more on that filing later in this article. Before his bankruptcy, 50 Cent’s fortune surpassed $100 million.</p><p>50 Cent purchased a 17-acre property in Connecticut in 2003, which includes a 50,000-square-foot residence with 37 bathrooms, 21 bedrooms, a gym, a casino, and a nightclub. He purchased the house from a bank that had recently evicted the previous owner, Mike Tyson. 50 Cent paid $4.1 million for the property and then spent another $6 million on upgrades such as a private movie theater, infinity pool, and helicopter pad.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jackson rose to prominence after releasing the controversial underground rap single “How To Rob.” He was about to release “Thug Love,” a single with Destiny’s Child, when he was shot and hospitalized in May 2000. A gunman had attacked him outside his grandmother’s home in Queens. An assailant (allegedly Darryl Baum, Mike Tyson’s bodyguard) fired nine shots, striking 50 Cent in the hand, arm, hip, both legs, chest, and left cheek. Three weeks later, the assailant was killed.</p><p>50 Cent was hospitalized for 13 days and signed a publishing deal with Columbia Records during that time. However, when he attempted to publish the song “Ghetto Qu’ran,” he was dropped by Columbia. He was also blacklisted by the recording industry in the United States as a whole, so he went to Canada to record songs for mixtapes in order to gain popularity. He released the mixtape “Guess Who’s Back?” in 2002.</p><p>Eminem discovered Jackson in 2002. Eminem was so taken with “Guess Who’s Back?” that he invited Jackson to meet Dr. Dre in Los Angeles. 50 Cent signed a record deal for $1 million and released “No Mercy, No Fear.” The soundtrack to Eminem’s film “8 Mile” included a song by 50 Cent. 50 Cent shot to fame in 2003 with his debut album “Get Rich or Die Trying.” It debuted at the top of the Billboard charts and sold nearly a million copies in the first four days. In just one week, the lead single, “In Da Club,” became the most-played song in radio history.</p><p>Interscope soon gave 50 his own label, G-Unit Records. “The Massacre,” Jackson’s next album, was released in March 2005. It was another smash hit, selling 1.14 million copies in its first four days and remaining at the top of the Billboard charts for six weeks. In 2007, his third album, “Curtis,” debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. The fourth album, “Before I Self Destruct,” was released in November 2009. Disagreements with his record label forced him to postpone the release of his fifth album, “Street King Immortal,” until November 2012. His studio albums have sold over 21 million units to date.</p><p>In 2005, 50 backed President George W. Bush after fellow rapper Kanye West chastised him for his slow response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Later, Jackson backed Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Despite the lyrics in many of his songs, Jackson does not use drugs or drink alcohol.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Relationship></span>Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>50 Cent has a son from a previous relationship with Shaniqua Tompkins. Marquise Jackson was born in the month of October 1996. Later, Tompkins sued Jackson for $50 million, but the case was dismissed. They’ve had numerous feuds on social media.</p><p>In May 2016, while walking through Cincinnati International Airport, Jackson harassed and insulted a janitor by accusing him of being under the influence. The janitor turned out to be an autistic and hearing-impaired adolescent. The video went viral, and the teenager’s parents wanted to sue 50 Cent. They settled for 50 Cent’s $100,000 donation to Autism Speaks and an apology.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimkZ63or%2FUqZyrnpGjwG%2BvzqZmbmhdmLKvwIyhnKKfmKl6qbvWZquapJxitrR506GcZq6VqbKzrc1mqZqoXajBor6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
