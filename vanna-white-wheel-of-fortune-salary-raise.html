The beloved game show co-host—arguably even more synonymous with Wheel of Fortune than longtime host Pat Sajak, who is retiring after this season—hasn’t received a pay raise in 18 years, according to Puck.
With her current contract ending at the conclusion of the 2023-24 season, the 66-year-old has hired Bryan Freedman, a well-known and aggressive entertainment lawyer, to secure a salary increase."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She currently makes $3 million a year for the syndicated version of the show, almost five times less than Sajak’s salary, according to Puck writer Matthew Belloni.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/20/vanna-white-partial-deal-celebrity-wheel-of-fortune/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to TMZ" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to TMZ</a>, negotiations between White and Sony are no hold because of the writer’s strike, but the two sides are currently very far apart.

And 20 percent of her male co-host seems low to me.”<br></p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Where Vanna Makes Her Money</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">White first joined Wheel of Fortune in 1982, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/a9651210/vanna-white-facts data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="replacing model Susan Stafford" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">replacing model Susan Stafford</a> as the show’s full-time letter-turner. Her popularity resulted in a wave of “Vannamania,” and she and Sajak have become one of the most iconic television duos of all-time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although White has reportedly not received a raise in 18 years, she has received bonuses over that time. In addition to the syndicated show, she also earns income from Celebrity Wheel of Fortune, which began airing on ABC in 2021. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://puck.news/vanna-white-would-like-a-raise/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to Puck" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to Puck</a>, White previously earned $55,000 per episode for Celebrity Wheel, but TMZ <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/20/vanna-white-partial-deal-celebrity-wheel-of-fortune/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="has reported" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">has reported</a> that her attorney negotiated that amount up to $100,000 per epsiode. In comparison, Puck reports Sajak earns $300,000 per episode on the spin-off, though TMZ states he earns more than $400,000.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">White also makes money from outside endorsements, as well as her real estate investment and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.lionbrand.com/products/vannas-choice-yarn data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanna’s Choice" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Vanna’s Choice</a> brand of yarn.

As far back as the 1990s, Sony had considered removing White to cut costs but ultimately decided against it out of fear of backlash from fans.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Vanna—who, by all accounts, is super nice and doesn’t court conflict—has always felt vulnerable, and she’s bought into the idea that she’s lucky to have the job,” Belloni wrote for Puck. “She also had a lawyer, Joe Horacek, who didn’t do much to help dissuade her.”<br></p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Her Aggressive New Attorney</h2><img alt="bryan freedman, wearing a gray wool coat, speaks into a microphone on a stage with a gray curtain in the background" title="Attorney Bryan Freedman in November 2021" width=5000 height=3431 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bryan-freedman-attends-the-pre-holiday-showcase-featuring-news-photo-1687979496.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Bryan Freedman speaks in Malibu, California, in November 2021.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The hiring of Freedman marks a more aggressive negotiating tactic in terms of White’s salary.
