But one member of the fam is definitely missing and fans took note.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>Cassie’s mom Maggie, played by character actor (and American treasure) Judy Greer in the first two <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ant-Man movies</a> is conspicuously missing from the cast. Given how invested Marvel fans are in these films, it makes total sense that this was noticed right away. So what gives? Is she out of the picture in more ways than one?</p><h2 id=h-why-isn-t-judy-greer-in-quantumania data-injectable=false>Why isn’t Judy Greer in Quantumania?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>now why didn't they add michael peña and judy greer to this. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/M6hG6CwglW</a></p>— m; (@odyneson) <a href=#>February 17, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>The obvious answer of course is, why would she be? Maggie was estranged from Scott during his stint in prison and married police officer Jim Paxton (played by Bobby Cannavale) in an attempt to create a normal life for Cassie (an objective that, as Cassie points out early in Quantumania, did not succeed). Despite Scott’s now widely recognized status as an Avenger by the time Quantumania begins, there’s still no reason for Maggie not to want to cling to her much more normal life far-removed from super-heroics and mad Titans.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>As for why Cassie is currently spending more time with Scott (and Henry and Hope), that answer is two-fold. With Henry, Hope, and Janet all having vanished in the blip, and Scott having been trapped in the Quantum Realm, Cassie may just be electing to spend time with the people she missed during their five-year absence.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>And [<a href=#>mild spoiler</a>] Cassie obviously has super-scientific aspirations of her own. The ability to hang out with<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> the brilliant Henry Pym </a>and Hope van Dyne as opposed to her mom and stepdad probably holds a lot of allure for Cassie (and they also seem to be forgiving of her indiscretions, like getting arrested).</p><h2 id=h-did-judy-greer-not-being-in-quantumania-curse-it data-injectable=false>Did Judy Greer not being in Quantumania curse it?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>jurassic world com judy greer: 71% no RT<br>jurassic fallen kingdom e dominion sem judy greer: 47% e 29%</p><p>halloween com judy greer: 79%<br>halloween kills matando judy greer: 38%</p><p>ant man com judy greer: 83%<br>quantumania sem judy greer: 48%</p><p>do judy greer wrong and you WILL get cursed <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6FsGO10usu</a></p>— huebinho (@hueb_marcelo) <a href=#>February 17, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>While Maggie isn’t in Quantumania there’s no reason to believe she isn’t still in Cassie’s life. But the screenwriters and director didn’t see fit to include a cameo for Greer. And that may cost them.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>An analysis of Rotten Tomatoes finds that films just do better if they include Judy Greer. Sometimes to a difference of almost 40 percent. Franchises like Halloween, Jurassic World, and Ant-Man all do better with Greer than without. We can’t say the current lackluster reviews are down completely to the lack of Greer in Quantumania, but we can say we think she may have helped.</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=false>We’re not sure Marvel really needs our advice when it comes to filmmaking, but if there ends up being another Ant-Man movie we definitely think they should bring Greer back. Who knows, maybe the <a href=#>fate of the MCU</a> depends on it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGdopp6qr%2BMnJisq5mawG65zqZkoqZdpsKiutOupJqmmZZ8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
