The Peacock Butterfly, for example, only appears on hybrid flowers. You need to create a hybrid flower if you want to catch it.&nbsp;</p><p data-injection=true>The first thing you need to create is a hybrid flower using what species you have available. While many players are reporting they capture the Peacock Butterly through a hybrid creation, most are noting it’s coming from specific colors, such as a purple, blue, and black flower. Each of the flowers requires different combinations of colors. For example, if you have purple roses, you need to use a pair of white roses if you want purple tulips you need two orange tulips, and if you wish to have purple pansies, you need two hybrid red pansies to make them. Roses or tulips are the easiest combinations, so try to add these to your island and have them readily available.</p><p>To make a hybrid flower, you need to place flowers next to each and give them a single space apart. You now need to water them daily, and eventually, a hybrid will sprout. When you have your hybrid ready, you now need to conform to the Peacock Butterfly’s pattern and routine. It only shows up from March to June in the northern hemisphere, and from September to December in the southern from 4:00 am to 7:00pm. You can probably find it landing on the hybrid you’ve created. When you see it, sneak up to it and try to capture it. You can sell it for 2,500 Bells to Tommy and Timmy in Nook’s Cranny.</p><p>You can find a variety of diverse bugs and fish, based on the correct conditions. Make sure to investigate every portion of your&nbsp;New Horizons&nbsp;island to see if any new bugs show up and if you can capture any new fish.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
