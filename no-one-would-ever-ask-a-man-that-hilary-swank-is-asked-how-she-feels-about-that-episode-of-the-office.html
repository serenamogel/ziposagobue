She said,</p><p>“I play real people and I think beauty is very subjective. I feel like no one would ever ask a man that.”</p><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>Further into the conversation, Swank—whose career spans over three decades and has been in more than 50 projects—disclosed that in the past, she was constantly bombarded with questions about possibly playing a character that is considered “a pretty girl.”The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alaska Daily</a> star added that the comment initially rubbed her the wrong way because she felt everyone she has portrayed and shared their story over the years was “beautiful.”</p><p>“I used to get asked often in my interviews you know, ‘you’re such a beautiful woman. You’re sitting here and you’re so beautiful. When are you going to play a pretty girl?’ It just blew my mind because the women that I play are so beautiful.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true><a title=@tiff_net href=#>@tiff_net</a><p>“No one would ever ask a man that.” 🗣️ <a title=hilaryswank href=#>#hilaryswank</a> <a title=theoffice href=#>#theoffice</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Billie Eilish Home" href=#>♬ original sound – Billie Eilish Home</a></figure><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false><br>Since the TikTok post went viral, it has generated over 6 million views and more than 736,000 likes.

In 2010, a year after&nbsp;The Office&nbsp;episode aired, Swank told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Time</a>&nbsp;magazine that she found that moment flattering after being made aware of it by loved ones. Still, Swank considers it a disservice to women because life is more important than how someone looks.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m not a big television watcher, but definitely everyone made me aware of it. It’s flattering anytime someone mentions you. But I don’t think of myself in terms of that.</p><p>There is so much [emphasis] put on the way we look, which is interesting, going back to the Office question. Are you hot, or are you not? It really does a disservice. There’s so much more to life than looking a certain way.”</p><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=102 data-injectable=false>At this time, it is unclear if any cast members from The Office will respond to Swanks’ remarks.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=102 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S7sHnOp5xmr5%2BquaV5xK%2Bcq2WRqLhurYymmKdlpJ2utXnHoqOaqqliwLitzaRkoqtdlsCsscNmn6ivXai1pnnFnpylq12Wr7DB02aroZmkYrKxtdKom55ln5t6tbTEZqafnpmYsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
