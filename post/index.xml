Low level languages give developers the chance to have very fast code with the minimum of commands necessary, but the closer you code to hardware the more difficult it becomes, and the developer should have a good grasp of the hardware in order to get the best performance. In theory, everything could be written in assembly language but that has some limitations. Programming languages, over time, have been abstracted from the hardware they run on which gives advantages to developers in that they do not have to micro-manage their code, and the code itself can be compiled against different architectures.</description></item><item><title>How many kids were on the ark</title><link>/how-many-kids-were-on-the-ark.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/how-many-kids-were-on-the-ark.html</guid><description>How many babies were born on the ark?
