In 2016, <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>he challenged Hip Hop’s homophobic attitudes</a>&nbsp;following the <a class=underline-link href=#>mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando</a> that killed 49 and injured 53 others.</p><p>“My heart and prayers go out to the&nbsp;LGBT community and everyone affected by this tragedy,” he tweeted at the time. “Really upset today. I wish there was more I could do than tweet, build awareness and donate money. Thats not enough. Not for me. The Hip Hop community is the least outspoken about gay rights and Ima go out my way to change that.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Cudi continued to hammer home his point by urging any homophobic fans to unfollow him on Twitter. “IF YOU ARE AN INSECURE HOMOPHOBE AND HAVE A ISSUE WITH GAYS AND EQUALITY, UNFOLLOW ME NOW. THANK YOU,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miiopxdmMKltYytoKudlGK1sLnOqZ%2BompWoerLBxKyroqeenruoedKer66ZnJ7Bug%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
