As a result, your credit card will be charged 120 percent of the rental fee + $200.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><b><span>In a similar vein, how much is the deposit on a rental car? </span></b><b><span></span></b></h3><p align=justify>The rental agent will place a hold on funds in the bank account associated with the debit card in an amount equal to the estimated rental charges plus a deposit, which is typically $200 to $300.
