But what about fettuccine? Well, let’s start with the basics—what is fettuccine? Fettuccine is iconically long, flat, and wavy. Though, you’d be surprised at how many variations of fettuccine there are out there that deviate from this structure. Personally, I think fettuccine is best as long and lovely ribbons. It can be made fresh with eggs and refrigerated, or it can be made with semolina and kept in dry storage. But here’s a spoiler: Most fresh egg pasta available at the grocery store sucks. You’re much better off making your own or going to a restaurant for that. However, bronze-cut and air-dried fettuccine is sturdy, reliable, and ideal for meat sauce and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">marinara</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">meatballs</a>. Having good fettuccine on hand at home also means that you’re only a few minutes away from fattening, comforting fettuccine alfredo. And what’s better than a dirty, American <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">alfredo</a>? All hail fettuccine—the perfect noodle vessel for some of the most comforting pasta dishes.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

La Molisana is just a perfect pantry pasta—it’s delightfully coarse, porous, bitey, and substantial. It’s artisanal and high quality without costing an absurd amount, either. My favorite part: As soon as you put the fettuccine in the water it immediately makes the water murky with starch. That’s important, as that pasta water acts as the perfect thickening agent for butter based sauces like alfredo. La Molisana fettuccine also picks up sauce very well because it’s bronze died (TK EXPLAIN THIS TO PEOPLE), and the chewy bite is unmatched. Also, it has eight grams of protein per serving, which is higher than other pastas on this list. That tells me this is made with quality semolina flour. This is the best fettuccine and, honestly, my new favorite brand of pasta.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc/Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BEST_FETTUCCINE_INSET_02.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for Bolognese</p><strong>Rustichella d’abruzzo</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Pavilions</a><p>Rustichella d’Abruzzo makes giant, thick, chewy, and floppy fettuccine noodles. They also have a firm bite and a wonderful durum wheat flavor. Semolina tastes slightly nutty and sweet, and while it makes for a less rich pasta than egg noodles, it’s still quite delicious. I ran into <a href=# rel=noopener>Mythical Kitchen</a>’s Nicole Enayati in the kitchen who said these were her fettuccine noodles of choice. I can see why! They’re so dense, thick, and chewy that I think they are the perfect fettuccine for a bolognese. Though not as wide, they have a real pappardelle quality to them. For that reason, this is the best fettuccine for meat sauce.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc/Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BEST_FETTUCCINE_INSET_03.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Reliable</p><strong>De Cecco Fettuccine No. 6</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Vons</a><p>You know I love De Cecco; they’re just totally reliable, appropriately priced, and steadily available. De Cecco fettuccine are made with cold mountain water and slow dried. These are beautiful little ribbons of pasta that actually taste kind of eggy. They have a soft, rich texture that I often associate with a yolk rich pappardelle. Mostly, though, I buy De Cecco because it’s reliable. It’s a sturdy, coarse pasta that can withstand a lot of cooking and won’t break in the pot or pan. Don’t overcook it, but if you do, it’ll still hold its shape well.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc/Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BEST_FETTUCCINE_INSET_04.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Richness</p><strong>Rao’s Homemade Fettuccine</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>Rao’s fettuccine is a quality store-bought pasta that’s chewy, coarse, and delicious. It says “may contain egg” on the back of the package, though the ingredients don’t explicitly list eggs. So, be careful of that if you’re a vegan. Regardless, this fettuccine does have a very rich quality, and as a result these little fettuccine ribbons are quite decadent. It’s Rao’s, so you know you’re getting a wonderful bronze died, porous texture that’s excellent for picking up sauce. It’s like egg pasta without the eggs!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc/Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BEST_FETTUCCINE_INSET_05.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Spinach</p><strong>Pasta Deliziosa Spinach Fettuccine</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>I really like these little spinach fettuccine hooks. The end of each noodle is curved, almost like a cane, and the taste is earthy and vegetal like spinach. These are actually vegan noodles made in an egg-free facility. They’re thin and not as long as some of the other noodles on this list, but still quite good. The earthy spinach flavor is the reason to buy these, though, and they would make for a great spinach fettuccine alfredo or a pasta primavera. There’s something very appetizing about a pasta that has color to it, and these starkly green noodles implore you to eat with your eyes.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc/Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other products we tried:</strong> Whole Foods Egg Fettuccine, Al Dente Spinach Fettuccine, Buitoni, Garofalo.</p><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>S</strong>hare your favorite foods with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFussStq66bk567pnnNqKadpJWofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
