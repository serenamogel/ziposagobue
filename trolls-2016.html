Yes, we are talking cannibalism here, but it is only threatened, not seen. One year, King Peppy (<a href=#>Jeffrey Tambor</a>) decides to fight back with the war cry, “No&nbsp;troll&nbsp;left behind,” and finds a way to allow his multi-hued subjects to flee to safety. For two decades, they have been left uneaten—until royal daughter Poppy (Kendrick) throws a loud rave party complete with fireworks. Branch (Timberlake), the Chicken Little of trollhood who is so glum that he is the color of mud, warns that the noise will draw the attention of their enemies. And soon enough, Bergen villainess Chef (<a href=#>Christine Baranski</a>, channeling <a href=#>Carol Burnett</a>), descends upon the wee revelers and scoops up a handful to feed to King Gristle (<a href=#>Christopher Mintz-Plasse</a>), who has never felt happiness.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Off Poppy goes to save her friends, batting away bizarre beasties on her journey, and is soon joined by a reluctant Branch. Opposites-attract tension ensues between the pair, who eventually decide to recruit a Bergen scullery maid named Bridget, who harbors a crush on the king, to distract him enough so they can allow the other&nbsp;<span>trolls&nbsp;to escape. Of course, a beauty makeover occurs Cinderella-style—swoopy&nbsp;troll&nbsp;hair is involved—but one can only do so much with a Bergen.&nbsp;</span></p><p>As Bridget, <a href=#>Zooey Deschanel</a> gives the most engaging vocal performance and manages to add much-needed pathos (she bemoans the fact that she smells like gravy) and comic energy to the proceedings as she vamps the self-centered Gristle. Of course, love eventually conquers all but it can’t camouflage the fact that this narrative is so weak that it is not just secondary to the musical numbers but perhaps even tertiary, considering the merchandising push behind this enterprise. Money, as they say, might not buy happiness. But for just $22.99, you can get a pink hoodie for the Poppy in your life with&nbsp;<span>troll&nbsp;hair attached. Just beware of hungry Bergens.</span></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tqaiknKh6c3yQbw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
