By Phillip Moyer | Published 1 year ago In December, visitors to Disney World’s myriad of theme parks will have to pay up to $20 more for a one-day, one-park ticket. The entertainment resort complex will raise prices at Disney’s Hollywood Studios, EPCOT, and Magic Kingdom, CNN reports. Disney World already raised its single-day ticket prices in February of this year."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The entertainment resort complex will raise prices at Disney’s Hollywood Studios, EPCOT, and Magic Kingdom,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN reports</a>. Disney World already raised its single-day ticket prices in February of this year. On top of that, both Disney World and Disney Land&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">raised the price</a>&nbsp;of their premium Magic Key passes in August of 2022.</p><p>Right now, the price range for all Disney World one-day tickets is $109-159. Come December, only Disney’s Animal Kingdom will retain that price. EPCOT’s new price range will be $114-$179, Disney’s Hollywood Studios will cost between $124-$179, and Magic Kingdom will cost visitors between $124-$189.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/disneyland-900x506.jpg><p>The price hikes aren’t limited to single-day passes, either. On December 8, some of Disney world’s annual passes will also increase in price. The cost of the Pirate Pass will increase by $50, the price of the Sorcerer Pass will go up $70, and the Incredi-Pass will cost parkgoers $100 more. The cost of the company’s lowest-tier annual pass, the Disney Pixie Dust Pass, will remain the same, costing $399.</p><p>Right now, only the Pixie Dust Pass is available for sale. The other passes are only available to current pass owners who want to renew their purchases. The Pixie Dust Pass is only available to Florida residents and allows pass holders to make up to three park reservations at a time on weekdays (excluding holidays and blackout days).</p><p>These price hikes come as Disney is in the process of making multiple changes to the company’s theme parks. The company temporarily shut down&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Thunder Mountain</a>&nbsp;at Disney World to remove racially-insensitive imagery. It has also shut down Disneyland’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones ride</a>&nbsp;for refurbishment. This same year, Disney World also opened the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser hotel and a new Guardians of the Galaxy-themed coaster.</p><p>Disney has also made a minor change to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s A Small World</a>, adding dolls in wheelchairs. The company is also slated to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">re-theme Splash Mountain</a>, removing its theming around the controversial&nbsp;Song of the South&nbsp;and replacing it with&nbsp;The Princess and the Frog.</p><p>All of these changes to Disney World and Disneyland come as Disney stock&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reaches record lows</a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>After the company’s quarterly earnings report, Disney suffered its biggest drop in stock price since the beginning of the 2020 pandemic. This stock drop comes despite record sales since executives reported high operating costs. The company reported a $1.5 billion loss in its most recent quarter, a loss that the company has partially blamed on high inflation.</p><p>Disney CEO Bob Chapek stated that the company will seek out ways to save money. The increase in Disney World ticket costs might be related to this venture. These troubles come despite record subscription numbers on the company’s streaming platforms.</p><p>These aren’t Disney’s only troubles. In recent years, Disney has been riding high off the success of its Marvel series and the timely launch of Disney Plus. However, recent releases by&nbsp;<a href=#>Marvel</a> have failed&nbsp;to gain an audience, a problem shared by the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;series <a href=#>Andor</a>, despite receiving glowing reviews from those who watched the series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnlJ7Ar7HYZq6oqpyZerW1wqScratdoryzsYyer6mdnqi2t7GNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
