April Marie will be on the program as a participant with her better half, Jake Cunningham. The former issued an ultimatum to the latter. Marie has made it clear that Jake either marries her or leave. Six couples who have been in a long-term relationship but are unsure whether to marry are featured in the reality program. One person in the respective relationship feels unsure about getting married, but the other is certain. As a result, on the program, couples will be switched and will date other people.</p><p>The official summary for The Ultimatum is as follows:</p><p>“Six separate couples on the brink of getting married. One spouse is eager to marry, while the other is unsure. An ultimatum is delivered, and they have just over eight weeks to commit to marriage or go on. In the interim, each will pick a new prospective mate from one of the other couples, in a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see two alternative possible futures.”</p><h2>Jake and April’s relationship history in The Ultimatum</h2><p>On The Ultimatum: Marry or Move Out, Jake and April will be a volatile pair. Similarly, on September 18, 2019, 23-year-old April Marie and 26-year-old Jake Cunningham started dating. On the same day, Cunningham changed his relationship status to “In a relationship.” In reality, his girlfriend, Marie, had also shown her affection for him by leaving a remark with three hearts.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/April-Marie-2.jpg alt="April Marie" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, during the last two years, the pair has had various ups and downs and has reached a point where they are unable to determine whether or not to marry. Jake is having difficulty making a big choice, whilst his influential girlfriend is eager to marry him.&nbsp;April was also shown admitting to her partner in the trailer for The Ultimatum: Marry or Move Out, which was released on March 29, 2022:</p><p>“I adore you, but I can’t wait any longer.” That’s why I’m issuing an ultimatum.”</p><p>However, as the clip progressed, Jake was shown developing feelings for another character on the program. After that, April was spotted sobbing in front of her boyfriend, who said:</p><p>“Should I remain with you since you’re sobbing and I’m sorry?” Or should I search for what I really want in life?”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/April-Marie-3.jpg alt="April Marie" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Furthermore, it seems that the pair will be splitting up in the forthcoming program since April and Jake’s Instagram no longer have each other’s images. On April 6, viewers will be able to watch the series on Netflix.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYZqSfpLhutc2tpmasmJp6trjToqSarKWieqS71KmjnmWRpb%2BquIymmKuhlWKur7CMo5iknV2Ywq%2B6yKeeoZmdYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
