For the 6th Annual Truth Awards in Los Angeles, the power duo and their daughter Zaya Wade all stepped out in coordinated suits that were a masterclass in color blocking. Zaya accessorized her look with a silver chain (matching her father) and a small fuchsia clutch. The event was held to highlight and celebrate Black LGBTQ+ accomplishments and contributions, which makes the Wade-Union geometric suits designed by tailor RichFresh, an even more perfect choice.

Wade and Union have been applauded for their earnest support of Zaya, who came out as transgender earlier this year. “Everyone allows her to re-introduce herself her name is Zaya Wade!” Wade wrote in an Instagram post about his daughter’s outfit from the event. “She has emerged as one of the young faces and voices for the LGBTQ+ community.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-the-parents-of-zaya-wade></span>Who are the parents of Zaya Wade?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On 29th May 2007, Zaya Wade was born in the USA.
