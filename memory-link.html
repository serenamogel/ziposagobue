We have to study hard and become full-fledged Gym Leaders as soon as possible...</i> <i>Chili: About that. If we had gone to N's Castle a year ago, the Seven Sages and the Shadow Triad wouldn't have escaped! Then, nobody would say something like “Three of you together make..."</i> <i>Cress: I guess you're right.</i> <i>Cilan: You think so? But it isn't that big of a deal. We may not have made it in time, but Team Plasma is still gone.</i> <i>Chili: Argh! It's because you say things like that. That's why people treat us like a joke! Like it takes all three of us together to make one great Trainer!</i> <i>Cress: You're overthinking it, but I can't say the possibility is zero.</i> <i>Cilan: Come on, you two... Don't you think it's a bit strange to get recognition and respect as Gym Leaders just for beating bad guys?</i> <i>Chili: I understand what you're saying. But if things go on like this, nothing will ever change. Even if we train, the other Gym Leaders will become that much stronger as well.</i><ul><li>Shadow Triad member appears</li></ul><i>???: Then... We'll battle you.</i><ul><li>Other two Shadow Triad members appear. "!" above Cress and Chili. "?" above Cilan.</li></ul><i>Cress: Based on your appearance, you must be the Shadow Triad. But why are you here?</i> <i>Shadow Triad: We came on a whim... To vent... To pass time... It doesn't matter.</i> <i>Chili: Three on three! The first one to beat them is the strongest among us!</i><ul><li>Battle commences</li></ul><i>Shadow Triad: Too easy...</i> <i>Shadow Triad: These three aren't worth worrying about. We must focus on the other Gym Leaders so that next time they won't get in our way...</i> <i>Shadow Triad: Well... Lord Ghetsis is waiting. We must catch that Pokémon.</i><ul><li>Shadow Triad depart</li></ul><i>Chili: C'mon! What was that? Come back here and say that again!</i> <i>Cilan: I mean... They were overwhelmingly strong.</i> <i>Cress: We have to admit it. The three Leaders of Striaton City make one full-fledged Trainer.</i> <i>Cilan: You're right. Chili. Cress. I think as long as the three of us act like the Gym Leaders we are now, nothing will ever change.</i> <i>Chili: I didn't think you would be the first to say that.</i> <i>Cress: Of course, I, Cress, was thinking about that, too.</i> <i>Cilan: All right. Let's resign as Gym Leaders and start our training over from the ground up. Then, I'm sure one of us will become a Trainer everyone recognizes as great.</i> <i>Chili: We're triplets. What we think is the same. So we just have to become as strong as each other, and then we can be Gym Leaders together again!</i> <i>Cress: OK.

What's up? Suffering from artist's block again?</i> <i>Burgh: Hmm... Bones, perhaps...</i> <i>Lenora: Bones...? This is a museum, so of course we have bones. What are you looking for? Your next motif?</i> <i>Burgh: Maybe... Or maybe not... Many Bug-type Pokémon have hard coverings, right? Their so-called exoskeletons. So I don't quite understand bones. Not at all, actually.</i> <i>Lenora: So, did you think you would understand something about bones if you came here? Sure thing! Make yourself at home! If you'd like, I can have my husband explain them to you.</i> <i>Burgh: Mmm... Well, for starters, what do bones mean to you?</i> <i>Lenora: When I was little, my dad worked in a mine, and he would always bring home bones he dug up. I was just a child, but I was brought under the spell of bones. What did the bones look like when they were part of a living being? Why are they shaped the way they are? Things like that captivated me.</i> <i>Burgh: Oohhh... I kind of understand. I'm also fascinated by the functional, efficient designs of Bug-type Pokémon, such as the shape of their legs.</i> <i>???: Hey there! What's everyone all gathered up for?</i><ul><li>Clay approaches.</li></ul><i>Burgh: What brings you here?</i> <i>Clay: Found a Fossil in Twist Mountain. I came to have Lenora look at it and see if ya wanted to keep it here or somethin'.</i> <i>Burgh: Clay. What do bones mean to you?</i> <i>Clay: Hmm? Well now... No matter who ya are or when ya die, bones are all that'll be left of ya. When ya think about it, it's amazin'. Even if ya die, ya can make money! Some Fossils are worth a lot, ya know!</i> <i>Lenora: I can't tell if you're kidding, but of course you would think that way. Burgh is trying hard to think about what bones mean to him. Don't be so flippant! So what kind of Fossil have you got there? Let me see.</i> <i>Clay: Here ya go! Whaddaya think? It's gotta be worth a mint as a specimen or as a collectible! Which is it?</i> <i>Lenora: Well, I mean this in a good way, but it's an ordinary Fossil. If it isn't worth much as a specimen, you can't sell it for much. But I'm curious about the soil attached to the Fossil...</i> <i>Burgh: What do you mean?</i> <i>Lenora: It's very subtle, but it's a bit different from the soil I usually see from Twist Mountain.</i> <i>Clay: That so? Guess my Twist Mountain still has unlimited potential! All right! I'll keep on diggin' my Clay Tunnel! Here, Burgh! That plain ol' Fossil's yours! Have a look at it and think about what bones mean to ya.</i> <i>Burgh: Thank you, Lenora. I guess it's OK that I have my own perspective on what bones mean to me, right?</i> <i>Lenora: Why not? You, me, Clay... We all have a different way of thinking about what bones mean to us. It would be kind of creepy if we all felt the exact same way, right? Anyway, I feel sorry for this Fossil. It's just resting, minding its own business, and everyone is saying this and that about it.</i> <i>Burgh: I know. I'll thank this Fossil by using it as a motif for one of my works.

Team Plasma's actions stirred the hearts of the public. People even worry about how to interact with Pokémon. Of course, it's good to think about that relationship, but still...</i> <i>Alder: Even if you're told to find an answer on your own... It's not exactly an easy thing to do now, is it?</i> <i>Brycen: That's why... If people can see my bond with my Pokémon when they're watching my movies, it might ease their worries... That was my reasoning...</i> <i>Marshal: Oh! I get it now! Can't communicate that just by holing up in the Gym and talking to challengers. But, are you gonna be all right? What if you get hurt during filming again?</i> <i>Alder: Marshal... Brycen has already decided. Sometimes worrying can destroy potential.</i> <i>Brycen: I'm fine. I have no doubts about my decision. Also, I appreciate Marshal's concern. I was young... I thought I could do any kind of action scene. So I would put myself in unnecessary danger. I thought this bravery was my value as a person. So... Instead of trying to communicate something through my acting, I simply sought amazing action. That was how I got hurt.</i> <i>Marshal: I think I understand. If you seek strength for its own sake, the reason why you wanted it in the first place becomes vague. And you end up desiring victory and nothing else.</i> <i>Alder: That's why I've also made an important decision. I'm going to resign as Champion! We in particular need to take another look at what it means to live together with Pokémon. The world at large is still shaken by uncertainty. So I have to show everyone a new hope.</i> <i>Marshal: Well, if that's what you've decided, Sensei. Even if I argue, that won't change your decision, will it?</i> <i>Alder: You've grown so much since you sought me out and asked to be my pupil. Could that be it? Did becoming part of the Elite Four help you grow up in its own way?</i> <i>Marshal: I thought that if I were strong, my Pokémon would become stronger. Maybe I grew up because my Pokémon taught me that this isn't always the case... Well then, will you spar with me?</i> <i>Brycen: I will observe.</i> <i>Alder: Thank you. I want to be sure my Pokémon are in top condition to challenge the Trainer who will become the next Champion.</i> <i>Alder: (shouts) To strength!</i> <i>Marshal: (shouts) To Pokémon!</i><h4><span class=mw-headline id=A_New_Light>A New Light</span></h4><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/c/c3/A_New_Light_flashback.png decoding=async width=256 height=192 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> A New Light flashback<p><i>A New Light</i> (Japanese: <b>あらたな ひかり</b> <i>A New Light</i>)</p><h5><span class=mw-headline id=Quotes_4>Quotes</span></h5><i>Iris: Yay!

I was thinking about the past. I traveled all over the world looking for a successor. I even went to remote places such as the Village of Dragons. That's where I met you, Iris.</i> <i>Iris: Yep! I was the strongest!</i> <i>Drayden: Yes. I was surprised. You were one with your Pokémon and battling with so much joy. Just watching you made me smile. Your opponents felt disappointed by their defeat, but at the same time they enjoyed the battle. It was completely natural for me to decide I wanted to make you my successor.</i> <i>Iris: I'm so glad I came to Unova! There are many different people and so many different Pokémon! And you know what... In the Village of Dragons, people take living alongside Pokémon for granted. I was surprised some people in Unova didn't think that way!</i> <i>Drayden: I found your reactions to be a breath of fresh air. And as a condition to leave the <a href=# title="Village of Dragons">Village of Dragons</a>, you wanted to broaden your experiences and become the Champion... So as I promised, I've been training you as a Trainer and as a Gym Leader. An order directly from Alder came as I was training you.</i> <i>Iris: Alder was smiling, though.</i> <i>Drayden: He lost to N and retrained himself. He asked me to help him with his special training, but it was ghastly. He wanted to become an immense obstacle for you, the new Champion... For that alone, he pushed himself incredibly hard.</i> <i>Iris: Alder was really, really strong! And even when I felt a bit weak, he encouraged us! He said that even when their backs are against the wall, my Pokémon have an intense look in their eyes. So, that's why I won, but I feel like I still have a lot to learn.</i> <i>Drayden: Don't forget that feeling. And now, if I may change the subject... When you came to Opelucid City, I gave you those clothes, right? You're the Champion, now. It's all right to dress up a little.</i> <i>Iris: Are these new clothes? OK. I'll change into them right now!</i><ul><li>Iris spins and changes clothes</li></ul><i>Iris: Wooow! It's such a flowing dress!</i> <i>Drayden: What is important is your mental preparation as the Champion, Iris. When I was little, <a href=# title="Poké Ball">Poké Balls</a> didn't exist yet. Sometimes Pokémon would run away from awful Trainers who didn't try to understand them.</i> <i>Iris: But you were fine, right? I can tell! Your Haxorus loves you very much! I've already decided! I know what kind of Champion I will be! There's a <a href=# title="Sinnoh myths">myth in Sinnoh that says the reason why Pokémon jump out is because they want to thank people</a>. I'm sure that we and Pokémon have helped each other and enriched the world since ancient times. These memories have been engraved in each Pokémon's heart!

Well, I get to do what I want to do, and while being a model may be difficult, most importantly, it's fun! But the hard parts are really hard.

If I make bad puns when I'm supposed to be telling a joke, doesn't it give people even more of an opportunity to tease me and start a funny back-and-forth?</i> <i>Skyla: Um...

It knew humans and Pokémon have lived and will live together. It knew that in this relationship, humans' actions have an enormous impact on Pokémon. That's why it helps the one who searches for truth... the one who opens the way to the future. It's not necessary... Separating black from white and humans from Pokémon! If you think in terms of each individual life, this world was in a state that couldn't be divided any further. Possibilities are born out of combining and fusing these different lives! There are some things we can understand only by doing this. It will give form to unseen things. These formulae will restructure the world and make it richer!
