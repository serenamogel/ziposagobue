WWE has no issue selling out Survivor Series. Then they added even more seats for the show.

It is now set for full capacity after such a great reception.</p><p>“WWE added the last four available sections, and if these sell, the Allstate Arena will reach full capacity for Survivor Series. Smackdown opened the front six rows of sections 206 and 207, as well as all of sections 106 and 107.”</p><p>WWE’s 2023 Survivor Series event currently has 1,718 available tickets, a setup/configuration for 16,860, and 15,128 tickets distributed. It appears that WWE is ready for anything at this point, and they plan to pack out the Allstate Arena.</p><p>We will have complete coverage of WWE’s entire Survivor Series built. We are likely to see some unexpected moments along the way, and WarGames is going to be a big part of that.</p><p>CM Punk and WWE are not talking, either. There are no reported plans from a reputable outlet promising his return at Survivor Series, or even hinting that it is a possibility. That obviously doesn’t change how excited Chicago fans are to see Survivor Series.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><p>What’s your take on WWE’s Survivor Series build so far?

These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX90e5BpZmtrX6zEpnnOqZynq12qvW6%2F1Kutoq6fp3q0sdGinKxlYmV%2FdHnTqGSfrZyheqStz5qaoqypYsCmrdOipaBlmaN6pLTInJigp18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
