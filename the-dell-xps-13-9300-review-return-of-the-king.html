Along the way, Intel has also joined AMD in more aggressively demarcating their integrated GPUs based on the price of the processor. Intel always had a small bit of variation in the included GPU, but for the most part, a Core i3, i5, or i7 U-series would generally offer the same 24 Execution Unit GPU configuration. With Ice Lake, the naming scheme now includes the GPU size in the processor name, with G1, G4, and G7 graphics options, meaning lower-priced Core i3 and i5 models will not necessarily be outfitted with the same iGPU as a Core i7.</p><table border=0 width=95%><tbody readability=1><tr class=tgrey readability=2><td colspan=10>Intel 10nm Ice Lake-U Series CPUs</td></tr><tr class=tlblue><td>AnandTech</td><td>Cores<br>Threads</td><td>Base<br>Freq</td><td>1C<br>Turbo</td><td>AC<br>Turbo</td><td>GPU<br>EUs</td><td>GPU<br>Freq</td><td>L3<br>Cache</td><td>TDP</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Core i7-1068G7</td><td>4 Cores<br>8 Threads</td><td>2.3</td><td>4.1</td><td>3.6</td><td>64</td><td>1100</td><td>8 MB</td><td>28 W</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Core i7-1065G7</td><td>4 Cores<br>8 Threads</td><td>1.3</td><td>3.9</td><td>3.5</td><td>64</td><td>1100</td><td>8 MB</td><td>15 W<br>25 W</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Core i5-1035G7</td><td>4 Cores<br>8 Threads</td><td>1.2</td><td>3.7</td><td>3.3</td><td>64</td><td>1050</td><td>6 MB</td><td>15 W<br>25 W</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Core i5-1035G4</td><td>4 Cores<br>8 Threads</td><td>1.1</td><td>3.7</td><td>3.3</td><td>48</td><td>1050</td><td>6 MB</td><td>15 W<br>25 W</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Core i5-1035G1</td><td>4 Cores<br>8 Threads</td><td>1.0</td><td>3.6</td><td>3.3</td><td>32</td><td>1050</td><td>6 MB</td><td>15 W<br>25 W</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Core i3-1005G1</td><td>2 Cores<br>4 Threads</td><td>1.2</td><td>3.4</td><td>3.4</td><td>32</td><td>900</td><td>4 MB</td><td>15 W<br>25 W</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This comes into play since Dell offers three processor options on the XPS 13, with both the Core i3 and Core i5 variants only offering the G1 graphics. To be clear, even the G1 Generation 11 graphics on Ice Lake are a larger GPU than the previous Gen 9.5 offered, with even the lowliest Core i3 featuring 32 Execution Units, but the full GPU in this laptop is only found if you choose the Core i7 model, which offers the 64 Execution Unit G7 graphics. It makes choosing the processor a bit more complex than it used to be, as it would be on an AMD-based laptop which follows the same mantra.</p><p>Dell shipped the XPS 13 review unit with the Core i7-1065G7, and as such this device does feature the full-sized GPU, and as we have seen in other Ice Lake based notebooks, the larger GPU is a significant improvement over previous designs.</p><h3>3DMark</h3><p><img alt="Futuremark 3DMark Fire Strike" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15911/116568.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="Futuremark 3DMark Sky Diver" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15911/116569.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="Futuremark 3DMark Cloud Gate" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15911/116570.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="Futuremark 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15911/116571.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="Futuremark 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited - Graphics" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15911/116572.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="Futuremark 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited - Physics " src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15911/116573.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In our first synthetic test, the XPS 13 finishes slightly behind other Ice Lake notebooks, but not by a wide margin.</p><h3>GFXBench</h3><p><img alt="GFXBench 5.0 Aztec Ruins Normal 1080p Offscreen" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15911/116555.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="GFXBench 5.0 Aztec Ruins High 1440p Offscreen" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15911/116554.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>We run the DirectX 12 tests from version 5 of GFXBench, and as expected, the XPS 13 scores right in the same range as expected.</p><h3>Tomb Raider</h3><p><img alt="Tomb Raider - Value" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15911/116565.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The original Tomb Raider has been a challenge on integrated GPUs, but with AMD’s Ryzen and Intel’s Ice Lake, the game is finally playable although without any extreme graphics settings enabled. Once again, the XPS 13 slots in right where it is expected.</p><h3>Rise of the Tomb Raider</h3><p><img alt="Rise of the Tomb Raider - Value" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15911/116567.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The first sequel to the re-launched Tomb Raider series is much more graphically demanding, and the XPS 13 slides out of the playability window even at the lowest settings we test at.</p><h3>Strange Brigade</h3><p><img alt="Strange Brigade - Value" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15911/116558.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Strange Brigade is a game with a wide-range of settings, and can be very playable even on integrated graphics. As seen with Rise of the Tomb Raider though, the XPS 13 is not quite as performant as some of the other Ice Lake notebooks we have tested.</p><h3>F1 2019</h3><p><img alt="F1 2019 - Value" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15911/116552.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Codemaster’s F1 simulator did not fare very well on the XPS 13, scoring well under expectations. This game can be very CPU limited as well, so TDP can be a major factor.</p><h3>Far Cry 5</h3><p><img alt="Far Cry 5 - Value" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15911/116553.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Like most of the other games, we see that Far Cry 5 is once again below other Ice Lake systems, but even on the best integrated system Far Cry is only barely playable regardless.</p><h3>GPU Conclusion</h3><p>Although the XPS 13 was outfitted with the top of the range Core i7-1065G7, with its full 64 Execution Unit GPU, the XPS 13 was not quite able to match some of the other Ice Lake systems we have seen. We will get into that a bit more in the thermals section, but this is likely due to Dell more aggressively clamping the processor to its recommended 15-Watt TDP, where other manufacturers may be more aggressive and allow 20+ Watts. Since the GPU is one area where more thermal headroom is always welcomed, this can have a larger impact than a CPU-bound task.</p><p>Otherwise, while the Ice Lake G7 GPU configuration is nothing short of a massive step up from Intel's earlier integrated GPUs, they are also competing with AMD in a field that's normally AMD's strength. So for as fast as the G7 configuration is, it and the XPS 13 end up trailing laptops based on the half-a-generation newer AMD Ryzen 4000 APUs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH52hZBqZq2glWKxprjLZq%2Bpq11mgG6FkmlnZqqVq7amw4yrnK2toqN6sLKMrZ%2BeZZueu6h7kw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
