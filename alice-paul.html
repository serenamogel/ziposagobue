Laurel, New Jersey, attending school in nearby Moorestown. She was the eldest child of William Mickle Paul I and Tacie Paul who later provided her with three more siblings. Influenced by her Quaker family (she was related to William Penn who founded Pennsylvania), she studied at Swarthmore College in 1905 and went on to do graduate work in New York City and England.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While in London from 1906 to 1909, Paul became politically active and unafraid to use dramatic tactics in support of a cause. She joined the women's suffrage movement in Britain and was arrested on several occasions, serving time in jail and going on a hunger strike.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Alice Paul's Accomplishments</h2><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Activist for Women's Right to Vote</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When she returned to the United States in 1910, Paul became involved in the women’s suffrage movement there as well.

Out of frustration with NAWSA's policies, however, Paul left to form the more militant Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/lucy-burns data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lucy Burns" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lucy Burns</a>.

In 1923 she introduced the first Equal Rights Amendment in Congress and in later decades worked on a civil rights bill and fair employment practices. Although she did not live to see the ERA added to the U.S. Constitution (to date it remains unratified), she did get an equal rights affirmation included in the preamble to the United Nations charter.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Until she was debilitated by a stroke in 1974, Alice Paul continued her fight for women’s rights.
