When the ambulance arrived, Paul was unconscious but breathing, so he was rushed to the hospital. He later woke up. When asked what happened, Paul said his wife made him soup, but it tasted bitter. Paul’s limited toxicology report turned up nothing. <a href=#>NBC News</a> says, however, they only tested for opioids, cocaine, and alcohol.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-daughter-s-suspicions data-injectable=false>A daughter’s suspicions</h2><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>With her dad in the hospital, Paul and Roxanne Doucette’s daughter went through her mother’s phone and discovered that her mom had been in contact with someone claiming to be the soap opera star Thorsten Kaye, who plays Ridge Forrester on <a href=#>The Bold and the Beautiful</a>.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>Roxanne’s daughter reportedly discovered texts from whomever it was urging her mother to “…. get rid of your husband honey — I need you so much.” According to <a href=#>CBS News</a>, when Doucett responded, she said, “made an amazing soup. Special potion. Maybe I could collect life insurance.”</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>Roxanne later called it a misunderstanding, and said the soup was spoiled. “I didn’t poison him. I’ve never, ever tried to poison him in any way whatsoever. I love him very, very much, and I would never try to kill anyone,” she said (via CBS News). Doucette did, however, tell the police she always wanted to meet a star and had wired the suspected catfisher <a href=#>$4,000</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Doucette resisted arrest</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true>WCVB Channel 5 Boston/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>Under suspicion of her husband’s attempted murder, police tried to speak with Roxanne Doucette and gain access to her phone and other electronic devices, but she resisted. She is accused of physically assaulting several officers at the scene. Roxanne was eventually subdued and taken into custody, where she was booked for resisting arrest and assaulting and beating a police officer, among other charges. She was later released.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>As of this report, Doucette had not been charged with her husband’s murder. She had, however, been ordered to stay away from her daughter and husband and to undergo a mental health evaluation.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=false>Referring to the Doucette case, Townsend, Massachusetts Police Chief James Sartell, said, “I just tell everybody to just kind of take a step back, take a deep breath. Think things through before you spread things, or before you think you know what’s going on. Sometimes it’s a little more complex than it seems” (via CBS News).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1sHnIrGSrp6iWu6%2BxjJ2mrpuVqcGmedOhnGavn6Kur3nWoaZmmZyhsqixw6WwZqifnsCwusSdZKGdomK1tr%2FBmqWdZZKasKLB0p5kraCVYq%2BwuMNmmKecXam1pnnBnpiurJmbwq15wJyrqKpdqbWwvtKtnKdlm5bGpnnTqKOdZZiav27Azmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
